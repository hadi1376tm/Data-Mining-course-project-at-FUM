6,Africana Studies,An Introduction to Africana Studies,Ainsley LeSure,"This course introduces students to the vibrant and contested field of Africana Studies by critically exploring and analyzing the links and disjunctures in the cultural, political, and intellectual practices and experiences of people of African descent throughout the African diaspora. Beginning with a critical overview of the history, theoretical orientations, and multiple methodological strategies of the discipline, the course is divided into three thematic units that examine intellectuals, politics, and movements; identity construction and formation; and literary, cultural, and aesthetic theories and practices in the African diaspora.",ainsley_lesure@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AFRI 0090
7,Africana Studies,Global Black Radicalism,Brian W E Meeks,"The decade from the mid-Sixties until the mid-Seventies witnessed the rise of Black Radicalism as a global phenomenon. The emergence of Black Power in the US, Brazil and the Caribbean, the consolidation of liberation struggles in Portuguese Africa and the rise of a Black Consciousness trend in Apartheid South Africa all represent key moments. What led young activists to embrace “Black Power?” What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa? What events in the Caribbean gave ascendancy to radical tendencies? And what forces contributed to the decline of these movements? This course seeks to answer these questions.",brian_meeks@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AFRI 0670
8,Africana Studies,"Monuments, History, and Memory in the United States",Renee Ater,"In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, monuments tied to the violent histories of slavery, colonialism, and white supremacy have received renewed interest and debate. Protestors and individuals have defaced, toppled, and petitioned for the removal of Confederate monuments and statues to the white male power elite. This symbolic retributive violence and sometimes ritual care signals a challenge to the long-lived monument. This reading course explores public monuments and the ways in which artists and communities have negotiated history and the politics of memory and remembrance in the United States. We will evaluate the meaning and purpose of monuments that define American public spaces, investigating the problematic narratives and historic controversies surrounding such objects. The removal of monuments asks us to question whose histories have been forgotten, ignored, or suppressed, and what monumental justice might look like.",renee_ater@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AFRI 0840
9,Africana Studies,The Black Vote: A Critical Interrogation of a Concept,Ainsley LeSure,"“The black vote” as a concept, simultaneously captures a truth and obscures reality. It reflects the truth that no other racial group comes close to the uniformity of Black Americans’ voting behavior within American electoral politics. Yet, it also obscures the diversity of political opinions and ideological dispositions that animate a dynamic black American public. If voting is an essential means to give citizens voice and their share in self-rule within a democracy, this course explores what it means for the stability of American democracy that the black vote does not reflect the political diversity of the black community.",ainsley_lesure@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AFRI 1085
10,Africana Studies,Contemporary African American Theatre,Lisa L Biggs,"This Africana Studies course moves thematically rather than chronologically through recent developments in African American theatre. It takes up core questions regarding Black aesthetics, representation, and the responsibility of theatre artists to themselves and to Black communities in the wake of the 1950-1960s Civil Rights Movement. Spanning the 1980s to the present, the course focuses on some of the most widely recognized African American theatre and performance artists and encourages students to develop their own talents as researchers, creative writers, and critical cultural producers.

11,Africana Studies,African American Women's History,TBD,"This course examines the cultural, economic, political and social history of Black women in the United States from slavery to the present. Through a variety of secondary and primary sources, film and other multimedia, the course explores the myriad ways that African American women have experienced and resisted the “double burden” of racism and sexism in United States history. The course will consider the legacy of slavery and how African American women have defined their own identities as individuals, wives, mothers, community leaders, activists and theorists. Paying careful attention to their diverse experiences, the course will examine Black women’s participation and leadership in a variety of institutions, organizations and social movements. Major course themes include labor, politics, internationalism, religion and family.", ,The Critical Review for AFRI 1170
12,Africana Studies,"Slavery, Democracy, and Racial Violence in the Americas",Marcelo Rosanova Ferraro,"This seminar will provide students with an introductory course about the origins of racial violence in the Americas. After a short theoretical introduction, the course will analyze the enslavement of Indigenous peoples and Africans and their descendants as a fundamental instrument of European colonialism and the expansion of capitalism. The following section will describe the role of slavery in the making of constitutional regimes and criminal justice systems across the continent during the Age of Revolutions. Finally, the last classes will focus on the legacies of slavery after emancipation by analyzing phenomena such as lynching, capital punishment, police brutality, and incarceration. The seminar will also illuminate the formation of different racial and legal regimes in the Americas by offering a transnational perspective that integrates the United States, Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, and Brazil as components of a longue durée Atlantic history.",marcelo_rosanova_ferraro@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AFRI 1270
13,Africana Studies,Caribbean Imaginations: Writing and Cultural Production,Warren Harding,"In the global imagination, the Caribbean is either thought of as a place for vacation or a place of extreme violence. This course calls for a deeper engagement with the region and its diaspora by surveying the writing and cultural production of the Caribbean to unpack the varying meanings of a Caribbean imagination in the historical and present moment. We will cover themes ranging from enslavement, indentureship, colonialism, racial formation, gender and sexuality, class, and migration to understand the various transformations in Caribbean literary and expressive cultures. Students will evaluate the aesthetic and political contributions that these imaginative works put forward in a broader understanding of the Caribbean. Materials include novels, short stories, poetry, film, music videos, and visual art. Readings will be inclusive of the Anglophone, Hispanophone, Francophone, and Dutch Caribbean.",warren_harding@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AFRI 1420
14,Africana Studies,The Black Digital Humanities,TBD,"What is the relationship between race, digital technology, and power? This question is the basis for studying and building with the “The Black Digital Humanities,” a space and tool to consider the intersections between Blackness, humanity, and digital technology, an umbrella term that includes all electronic devices, systems, and resources that produce, process, or store information. In this course, students will spend the semester exploring the ways digital technology offers opportunities to revisit, reconsider, and reimagine knowledge about the Black experience in the United States and beyond. Drawing on Black epistemologies, students will utilize, adapt, and attempt to break digital technologies to both analyze and build things that help us pose new and different questions about the human. Course readings will include texts in digital studies, new media, and the digital humanities.", ,The Critical Review for AFRI 1480
15,Africana Studies,Making and Remaking Blackness in the Western World,TBD,"This course is an interdisciplinary survey of cultural, social, and political expressions of Blackness among people of African descent in the Western World, primarily the United States, and the social forces that create various understandings of this identity. Black experiences of and reflections on what it means to be Black are articulated in writing, visual and performing arts, music, and social media. Students will read, listen, and view a wide of set of materials that reflect people of African descent and their negotiation, rejection, and reimagination of different forms of Blackness in affirmative and complex ways from the 18th century to the present.

We will also consider the role of science and medicine in reinforcing as well as challenging social and racial inequalities over the past century.",deborah_fran_weinstein@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AMST 0150R
20,American Studies,Musical Youth Cultures,Kiri M Miller,"This sophomore seminar explores how and why young people form communities around popular music. We will discuss readings and documentary films about musical subcultures, media circulation, and how young people make music meaningful in their lives. The course requires critical engagement with a variety of popular music genres and cultures, as well as reflection on our own musical production and consumption practices. Major topics include punk, hip-hop, metal, rock, and club music; popular music and intersectional identity (including race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and disability); fan communities; activist musical collectives; music-sharing technologies; the politics of style; and ethnographic theory and method.",kiri_miller@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AMST 0170D
21,American Studies,Cry for Justice: Asian American Literature of Social Activism,Yuanyuan Feng,"The fact that Asian American literature has a protest tradition makes it a powerful site to highlight and re-animate Asian Americans’ overlooked histories and struggles for social justice. Through reading a variety of genres including poetry, fiction, autobiography, and memoir by authors from different Asian American communities, this course will examine the hidden history of Asian immigrant radicalism, dismantle stereotypes against Asian Americans, explore solidary and sustainable activism, and assert that literature has been and remains a fundamental site for Asian Americans’ active resistance to racial, class, gender and sexual oppression.",yuanyuan_feng@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AMST 0190L
22,American Studies,US Popular Culture,TBD,"This course focuses on the relationship between popular culture, media, and society and provides an overview of social structures, content, audiences, and effects. The core mission of this class is to connect popular culture to the larger world in which it is produced and consumed. We examine the institutional and social contexts of cultural production and consumption in the United States. We will cover a variety of cultural forms (e.g. music, film, tv, and social media) and explore culture as an arena of conflict and a vehicle for social change. Other areas of focus include the meaning of aesthetics and style in daily life, cultural gatekeeping, and the role of social media platforms in shaping the production, distribution, and consumption of cultural texts/commodities.", ,The Critical Review for AMST 1611S
23,American Studies,Popular Ideas: United States Political Culture From Above and Below,Samuel Zipp,"This junior seminar will explore public debates shaped by interactions between the everyday worlds of popular culture and the formal spheres of intellectual debate and ideas. Organized around case studies from several periods of U.S. history, the course will examine how key themes in American culture and politics—democracy and capitalism, equality and exclusion, freedom and domination, war and peace, modernity and tradition, empire and internationalism—have been shaped by ideas originating from both popular entertainments and movements as well as the treatises of philosophers, essayists, or reformers. Learning to understand the cultural history of U.S. democracy from above and below will suggest how ideas emerge from both spheres, and will suggest how public conflicts and debates are always about how the “public” was itself constituted across time.",samuel_zipp@brown.edu,The Critical Review for AMST 1700R

27,American Studies,Black Queer Life,Kiana Murphy,"This course explores how Black writers and artists represent and theorize a diverse array of Black genders and sexualities. We will begin with a series of conversations on the origins of Black queer theory, and then use these conversations to anchor us in our readings of Black queer life in literary and popular culture. Reading across a range of genres, including film, music, poetry, comics, and short fiction, we will collectively consider the ways sex, gender, and sexuality work with other markers of difference and social status such as race, class, ability, and nationality to demarcate possibilities, freedoms, choices, and opportunities available to Black people. We will learn from theorists, writers, and artists including Audre Lorde, Cathy Cohen, E.

30,American Studies,Immigration and the Borders of US Empire,TBD,"Since the founding of the United States, we have debated and struggled over the contours of American nationhood, who may claim the rights and protections provided by the state, and where the boundaries of inclusion/exclusion are drawn. This course will focus on two interrelated themes. The first is the implementation of immigration and nationality controls designed to manage cross-border traffic and restrict membership in the national community. The second is to explore how the projection of US power beyond its territorial borders (e.g. US empire) has fueled cross-border movement between metropole and colonial/postcolonial zones. We will highlight the ways in which the US’s encroachment of borders outside its territorial domain raises important questions about the meaning and legitimacy of national sovereignty and the legal production of immigrant “illegality.”", ,The Critical Review for AMST 2221B

We will explore the construction of border communities, lives and identities on both sides of the international divide, and pay particular attention to the movement of peoples in both directions. We will read materials, watch films, and conduct class discussions in English and Spanish. Comfort and reasonable proficiency in Spanish is required, but native command is not necessary.

34,American Studies,Contemporary Indigenous Education in North America,Adrienne J Keene,"In the past, formalized schooling in Indigenous communities was a tool of colonization and cultural genocide, forcing Native peoples to assimilate to western norms, values, and knowledge. However, contemporary Indigenous communities have managed to reclaim and reshape education for Native youth, utilizing innovative methods and technologies, as well as drawing upon generations of traditional and indigenous knowledges to create environments that promote academic achievement alongside culture. In this course we will focus on the ways Native communities are asserting their educational sovereignty, through culturally-relevant/responsive curriculums, language immersion schools, indigenous charter schools, traditional ecological and scientific knowledges, and more.",adrienne_keene@brown.edu,The Critical Review for ETHN 1200B
35,American Studies,Introduction to Latina/o/x Cultural Studies,Leticia Alvarado,"This course serves as an introduction to the many discourses that structure and challengewhat it means to be Latina/o/x in the United States. Through historically situated critical analysis of Latina/o/x cultural production, including theoretical essays, literature, and film, we will meditate on the major issues that shape the Latina/o/x experience. We will study how Latinidad—the sense of being Latina/o/x—is constructed as an identity and how that identity varies across origin, place, and time. Major themes we will explore include include the legacies of U.S. colonialism; cultural nationalism, citizenship, immigration and exile; labor and class; race and ethnicity; and gender and sexuality.",leticia_alvarado@brown.edu,The Critical Review for ETHN 1200G
36,American Studies,Introduction to Asian American History,TBD,"This course provides an introduction to the histories of people of Asian descent in the United States from the late 18th century to the present. We will focus on the experiences of people with ancestries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central Asia, considering commonalities and differences by nationality, class, gender, religion, place, and other factors. Topics include orientalism in U.S. culture, immigration and exclusion, Asian American civil rights struggles, and the “model minority.” We eschew any claim that an “authentic” or “typical” Asian American experience exists, instead working from the idea that Asian Americans and their lives are multifaceted, complex, and dynamic. Course materials will include primary and secondary sources and incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship and approaches while being anchored in history.", ,The Critical Review for ETHN 1200N
37,American Studies,Extravagant Texts: Reading the World Through Asian American Literature,Daniel Kim,"In this course we study a body of writings that self-consciously move beyond the topics and genres with which Asian American literature has traditionally been associated—that are, in Maxine Hong’s Kingston’s formulation, “extravagant.” We explore works that adopt a transnational or diasporic perspective and that are written in such genres as magical realism, speculative fiction, and poetry. In addition to more conventional concerns like racism or immigration, these works also address such issues as empire, war, mixed-race identity, environmentalism, adoption, and sexuality.",daniel_kim@brown.edu,The Critical Review for ETHN 1750S

39,American Studies,Bodies at Work: Disability and Capitalism,Emily Rogers,"If disability has been defined as the inability to work, then an exploration of disability necessitates an exploration of capitalism. Workplaces literally injure and disable bodies, while changing arrangements of labor define and redefine what makes something a disability, requiring new tasks of bodies at work. This course traces the dynamic relationship between bodies and economies over the course of American history from the birth of industrial management science in the nineteenth century, to the “essential worker” of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nimbly moving back and forth between disability studies and labor history, we will develop the conceptual tools to understand capitalism through the lens of disability, while also generating new ways to think about disability via critical histories of capitalism. We will also look at how disabled people have pushed back, envisioning new ways of valuing bodies beyond productivity. DIAP WRIT",emily_rogers@brown.edu,The Critical Review for STS 1700R
40,American Studies,"Senior Seminar in Science, Technology and Society",Debbie Weinstein,"This is an advanced seminar that uses a Problem Based Learning style pedagogy to explore real-world problems in STS.

41,Anthropology,"Many Faces of Culture, Contemporary Meanings and Uses",Lina M Fruzzetti,"Focusing on a key anthropological understanding, the meaning of culture, we will proceed to critically explore the multifarious uses of this concept throughout the seminar. Examining the indiscriminate uses of the concept of culture across disciplines we will endeavor to concentrate on its multiple meanings exclusive to and beyond anthropological discourse.
In our effort to analyze how the idea and meaning of culture have been appropriated by other disciplines, we will probe issues of gender and identity, philosophy, literature, politics, race, and ethnicity as well as politics and representation. These are a few of the suggested themes /topics that we will attempt to cover during the semester. Our task is to comprehend the changing meaning of culture, a cornerstone of anthropology, within and outside our discipline. How central is the idea of culture today to our discipline?",lina_fruzzetti@brown.edu,The Critical Review for ANTH 0066Z

43,Anthropology,Past Forward: Discovering Anthropological Archaeology,Parker VanValkenburgh,"This course offers a broad journey through the human past, from material culture crafted by our evolutionary ancestors to the remnants of the recent historic past. To facilitate this journey, the class explores the methods, concepts, and theories that anthropologists employ in the study of past peoples, places, and things. Case studies stretch across the globe. As a hands-on endeavor, archaeology focuses on tangible evidence. In this course, small-group discussion, laboratory, and field exercises will complement lectures, leading to an understanding of how anthropologists study the past and how that knowledge affects the present.",parker_vanvalkenburgh@brown.edu,The Critical Review for ANTH 0500
44,Anthropology,Gendering Migration and Diasporas,Nadje S Al-Ali,"This course will employ a decolonial and transnational feminist approach to explore gender and sexuality as central lenses in our understanding of different forms of migration and diasporas. We will address the various ways that experiences, processes and consequences linked to different migrations are gendered. The course will introduce a range of geographical contexts and empirical examples/case studies with the aim to challenge the US centrism existent in many academic debates. We will analyze relevant power relations and forms of oppression, as well as resistance strategies by migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. The course will use an intersectional lens to explore the way different power configurations interplay in specific contexts, paying particular attention to patriarchy, heteronormativity, nationalism, racism, Islamophobia and class-based inequalities. We will engage economic, political, social and cultural dimensions, but also the politics of non/belonging, and cultural productions.",nadje_al-ali@brown.edu,The Critical Review for ANTH 1225

Students will engage in discussions of recovery with community partners. Enrollment limited to 20.",irene_glasser@brown.edu,The Critical Review for ANTH 1300
46,Anthropology,Global Health: Anthropological Perspectives, ,"This course explores the distinctive contribution that a critical approach—primarily that of medical anthropology—can make to the rapidly changing field of global health. The course takes a problem-based approach and focuses on “grand challenges,"" such as those posed by global pandemics, humanitarian crisis, or the limited reach of child and maternal health programs in “resource-poor” locations. Through ethnographic case studies, we will examine how the concepts and practices associated with global health interventions travel to different parts of the world and interact with local agendas.", ,The Critical Review for ANTH 1310

How does the sovereign display its marks and perform or exercise its supreme authority? How is it questioned or undermined? These are matters of political imagination and public contestations no less than of legal definitions and conceptual distinctions. This is also where the problematization of the very idea of sovereignty may begin. We will study these questions by following the sovereign’s language, time, impunity, and unruly subjects. Our stories, images, and concepts will be drawn from a variety of sources: early modern (Machiavelli, Hobbes), modern (Schmitt) and contemporary political theory (Honig, Butler, Sawyer); modern literary fictions (Melville, Kafka); journalistic essays on autocrats, abroad and at home (Snyder, Gessen); and anthropological accounts of “stateless societies” (Clastres, Graeber).",adi_ophir@brown.edu,The Critical Review for HMAN 1975S

At a time when the country was already socially and politically riven by issues such as women’s and workers’ rights, temperance, nationalist extremism, and antisemitism, this conflict exacerbated and supplied a platform for talking about the cultural divisions of a country in the process of modernization.

549,German Studies,Geräuschkulissen / Background Noises,Thomas G Schestag,"The distinction between noise and voice and speech is porous. This porosity challenges the very definition of human beings who alone, as political beings, according to Aristotle, dispose of articulated speech–lógos-, although sharing voice–phonè–with other animals. The Latin writer Varro holds that children uttering first words do not yet speak; they resemble crows and ravens more than human beings. Their speech borders on sheer noise.
Texts to be read include a section from Aristotle’s History of animals; Echo and Narcissus in Ovid’s Metamorphoses; Poe’s poem The Raven; a chapter from Melville’s Moby Dick; short stories by Kleist, Hebel and Kafka; The Mathematical Theory of Communication by Shannon/Weaver.

Texts to be read include The Aesop Romance; Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels; a chapter from Rousseau’s Essai sur l’origine des langues; Goethe’s novella Die neue Melusine; fairy-tales by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm; a chapter from Nietzsche’s Also sprach Zarathustra; Pär Lagerkvist’s novel Der Zwerg; and a poem by Stefan George: Das Lied des Zwergen. –– Taught in German.",thomas_schestag@brown.edu,The Critical Review for GRMN 1441J

For his innermost circle, George’s poetry and persona were at the center of concern, yet in such a way that nothing less than a new world order was at stake: the poet-as-Führer was supposed to realize the realm that came to be called “secret Germany,” or: “die geheime Gemeinschaft der Dichter und Weisen, der Helden und Heiligen, der Opfrer und Opfer, welche Deutschland hervorgebracht hat und die Deutschland sich dargebracht haben” (Kantorowicz).

Yet what if survival were not something added on to life but rather constituted it? Our seminar will test the hypothesis that surviving is the most intense and powerful form of living possible. Readings will be drawn from literature, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and critical theory, including Kafka, Benjamin, Freud, Canetti, Derrida, Lyotard, and Agamben. We will also examine Lear’s philosophical case study of radical vulnerability as it emerges in the aftermath of the Crow Nation facing eradication of their way of life, Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation.

573,History,History of Capitalism,Lukas B Rieppel,"Capitalism didn't just spring from the brain of Adam Smith. Its logic is not encoded on human DNA, and its practices are not the inevitable outcome of supply and demand. So how did capitalism become the dominant economic system of the modern world? History can provide an answer by exploring the interaction of culture and politics, technology and enterprise, and opportunity and exploitation from the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade to the 2008 Financial Crisis.

Beginning in antiquity and ending in the present, this course draws on materials from a variety of cultures across the world to explore incarceration's centuries-old past. In examining the experience and meaning of imprisonment, whether as judicial punishment, political repression, or the fallout of war, the class will ask fundamental questions about liberty as well. History 150 courses introduce students to methods of historical analysis, interpretation and argumentation. This course presumes no previous history courses.",amy_remensnyder@brown.edu,The Critical Review for HIST 0150C
575,History,Colonial Latin America,Jeremy R Mumford,"Colonial Latin America, from Columbus's voyage in 1492 to Independence in the nineteenth century, was the creation of three peoples: Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans. Spanish and Portuguese conquerors brought with them the world of the Crusades, the Inquisition, and the Renaissance. Native Americans lived there already, in rich empires and hunter-gatherer bands. Africans came as slaves from Senegal, Nigeria, Congo and Angola, bringing old traditions and creating new ones. These diverse peoples blended together to form a new people. This was a place of violence, slavery and oppression -- but also of art, faith, new societies, new ideas. P",jeremy_mumford@brown.edu,The Critical Review for HIST 0233

578,History,History of Medicine II: The Development of Scientific Medicine in Europe and the World,Harold J Cook,"From the 18th century onward, Western medicine has claimed universal validity due to its scientific foundations, relegating other kinds of medicine to the status of ""alternative"" practices. The course therefore examines the development of scientific medicine in Europe and elsewhere up to the late 20th century, and its relationships with other medical ideas, practices, and traditions.

It was a project.” During the 20th century struggles against colonialism, the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America believed that another world was possible. Here, too, in the United States, minorities and their allies dreamed of dignity, democracy, and justice. Looking through the experiences of Asian Americans, this course examines the domestic freedom movements in the context of global decolonization.

This course examines information overload in Early Modern Europe (1500-1800) and its connection to early modern data science. We will engage with the forms of information overload: knowledge access and use, community and social bonds, commodification, and even as a non-issue. Using a varied assortment of primary sources—from copyright laws to herbariums to account books—along with developing techniques to read academic articles and books, this class will help you begin to analyze the past with the tools of a historian. You will find that modern familiarity of “information overload” provides an entry way into thinking about the authority placed—and constructed—on information both in the early modern period and now.", ,The Critical Review for HIST 0622A

He has also embraced (as have several leaders before him) some of the political and social ideals of Confucianism—ideals first stated in the sixth century BCE. This lecture-and-discussion course traces the history of Chinese political thinking from the first Chinese state to the present, emphasizing first, those ideas that continue to shape Chinese notions of governance, and second, comparisons between these and American political ideals.

593,History,Central and Eastern Europe and the Trajectory of History,Holly A Case,"At the center of modern contacts and conflicts between orders (dynastic and revolutionary), empires (Habsburg, German, Russian, Ottoman), ideologies (fascism and communism), and nations, Central and Eastern Europeans have long reflected on the trajectory of history. Many of their ideas have influenced more recent reflections beyond the region on whether the unfolding of history can be best described as cycles, an arc, an apocalyptic dive, entropic attenuation, or mere chaos. We will discuss the experience and ideas of Hegel, Marx, Patočka, Arendt, and others, together with those of more recent groups and individuals—from advocates for racial justice, to environmental activists and theorists, to hackers, programmers, and futurologists, to the alt-right, to Russian thinkers behind Putin’s war in Ukraine—who have sought to understand, describe, and influence the course of history.",holly_case@brown.edu,The Critical Review for HIST 1236

But what exactly is a “community”? What does it mean to be a part of one, and/or multiple communities simultaneously? To what extent are communities inclusive discourses and processes, or exclusive—and must communal solidarity for some, mean alienation for others? Taking the making and breaking of communities as our theme, and the Middle East, South Asia, and Indian Ocean as our arena, this seminar explores how historians of these intersecting regions have addressed the question of community in their scholarship. In so doing our seminar engages landscapes, seascapes, and experiences integral to the making of the early modern to contemporary world, while connecting peoples and environments of Eurasia, Africa, and the Global South more broadly.",faiz_ahmed@brown.edu,The Critical Review for HIST 2981X

Proceeding from close examination of historically-specific artistic practices, ranging from the medieval sculpture of China’s “Mountain that Flew” to the land art of the 1960s, it excavates the predispositions and assumptions embodied in particular “geoaesthetics,” and situates these aesthetics in the long history of human efforts to transcend the temporal and spatial scale of the human body. Moving from the “climatic artistry” of the medieval Deccan and the thinking forests of the Amazonian Runa to the formation of modern geological science and the creation of the metric system, it considers the challenge of a deep history of geoaesthetics to contemporary theorizations of hyperobjects, planetarity, and the Anthropocene.",jeffrey_moser@brown.edu,The Critical Review for HIAA 2215

Algorithmic models, Artificial Intelligence, and everyday processing of vast amounts of data increasingly shape both our private choices and opportunities, and also our interactions in the public sphere. These developments raise new ethical and normative political questions and prompt us to examine the role of values such as freedom, autonomy, equality, and privacy in the digital sphere. How should a self-driving car behave when a crash is unavoidable? Are engineers responsible for the decisions of artificially-intelligent systems? What is the value of privacy in a world that increasingly depends on large amounts of data about customers, citizens, or patients?

787,Philosophy,Living Like An Ancient Greek Philosopher,Emily Kress,"This class is a study of how the ancient Greek and Roman philosophers conceived of the place of philosophy in a good human life, focusing on Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Epicureans, the Stoics, and the Pyrrhonian Sceptics. We will consider and critically assess the possibility--prominent in some recent scholarship--that for many of these philosophers, philosophy itself was a way of life. We will therefore ask what it would be to live in a philosophical way and what, if anything, might make such a life a good one. Our inquiry will also have a practical dimension, with opportunities to try out these philosophers' recommendations and to reflect on how this experience can help us understand their arguments.",emily_kress@brown.edu,The Critical Review for PHIL 0991S
788,Philosophy,Free Will and Moral Responsibility,Nomy Arpaly,"This seminar introduces the problem of free will and moral responsibility as seen by contemporary philosophers. Do we have free will? What would it be like to have free will? What kind of freedom, if any, is required for humans to be blameworthy or praiseworthy for their actions? What other things might be required? Can there be moral responsibility if everything that happens is causally determined? Can there be meaningful lives if everything is determined? And what is one to make of the typical ""scientists prove there is no free will"" newspaper headline?

792,Philosophy,Epistemology,David P Christensen,"We’ll concentrate on several issues involving knowledge and rational belief: What is knowledge, and how does it relate to rational or justified belief? Does a person’s knowing something depend on non-evidential factors such as the practical importance of the person’s being correct? Does the justification of a person’s belief depend just on facts internal to the person—or might it depend on her environment? And what can we learn from thinking about the skeptical position which claims that we’re not justified in believing even the most ordinary things about the world around us?

798,Philosophy,Reason and Sentiment in 18th Century Philosophy,Paul D Guyer,"We will examine differing conceptions of the relations between reason and sentiment or moral feeling in eighteenth-century moral philosophy. The obvious questions are meta-ethical and moral-psychological: Are moral judgments based on sentiment or on some form of reason itself? Is only sentiment motivational? If reason can be motivational, is it so directly or through some form of sentiment? But we will also consider whether different meta-ethical positions are connected with different results in normative ethics. We will read and discuss works by Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Schiller. Participants will be expected to present an oral report and a term paper.",paul_guyer@brown.edu,The Critical Review for PHIL 2207
799,Philosophy,Recent Debates About Mental Representation,Christopher S Hill,"Mental representations include perceptual states, concepts, thoughts, beliefs, desires, intentions, plans, images, perceptual simulations, maps, and emotions. We'll focus primarily on perception, concepts, propositional attitudes and look at: What's the relationship between the format of perceptual states, on the one hand, and the format of beliefs and other concept-involving states, on the other? What's the role of perception in helping to determine the contents of our beliefs and concepts? What's it for a concept to refer to an object or property in the world, and what's it to have a certain belief or desire? How metasemanatically tolerant are our beliefs about the external world? Could many of our beliefs still be true, even if we are living in a computer simulation? Readings will include recent work by Ned Block, David Chalmers, Karen Neander, Nicholas Shea, and J. Robert G.

844,Political Science,Politics of Economic Development in Asia,Ashutosh Varshney,"It is accepted that development is not an economic phenomenon. Political processes are tied with economic development. Does the political system affect development? Does democracy slow down economic growth? If countries embrace political freedoms and market-oriented economic reforms, should one expect both to succeed equally?

When, in turn, are we unfree at work, and what kinds of unfreedom are we subject to that are peculiar to modern life? Such questions press with particular urgency at a time when both unemployment and overwork are major complaints, and when many people find that work takes up the majority of their day yet is unsatisfying.

State-based institutions play an important role in explaining the level of disorganized or organized crime. Organized crime groups, in turn, influence both state-based institutions (for example, through corrupting officials) and other criminal activity, often by creating the “rules of the game” by which other criminals can act. Finally, both state-based and criminal actors and institutions influence the level of violence in society. Each of these three influences, and is influenced by, the others. This course offers the opportunity to better understand how these three factors relate to each other.",david_skarbek@brown.edu,The Critical Review for POLS 2040

This course examines the history of black political thought, focusing on the answers black thinkers have formulated to key questions in political theory, such as: What is justice? What is freedom? What are the conditions of possibility for democracy? How should we theorize race? What is racial justice? More than other intellectual traditions, black political thought has been centrally concerned with racism and inequality, but also black refusal and black life. We will pay special attention to the distinctive concepts and modes of theorizing developed by black thinkers, particularly how they conceive the relationship between race, class, gender, sexuality, etc. Rather than providing an overview of black political thought in all times and places, the course will focus on close readings of a few key thinkers.",juliet_hooker@brown.edu,The Critical Review for POLS 2390
864,Political Science,"Necessity, Labor, Freedom",Alexander H Gourevitch,"Is work a constraint or an act of freedom? Is it the path to self-consciousness or self-abnegation? How do these questions inform normative concerns about the emancipation from work, the role of domestic labor, the right to work, the ideal of a basic income, and the social guarantee of free time? Given that actual work falls far short of the ideal, what is the politics of work? Who should do what to transform or eliminate work? To answer these questions, we begin with readings by figures like Hegel and Hagglund on labor, service and human finitude. We then discuss readings on subjects like the right to work, feminist critiques of domestic labor, universal basic income, and shared labor. Finally, we turn to arguments for self-emancipation – of slaves from slavery, women from housework, wage-workers from capitalist labor.",alexander_gourevitch@brown.edu,The Critical Review for POLS 2395

It begins with traditional West African religions, moves through religious and cultural formations of the Caribbean, and concludes with Black religio-racial movements in the United States. As we survey ritual objects, sacred texts, sermons, songs, and spells, students will scrutinize the ways particular constructions of race and religion have influenced Black religious life and practice. Central questions include: ‘What does Africa have to do with Black religions?’ ‘Why did enslaved Africans become Christians, and how did they change Christianity?’ ‘What does it mean to say, ""God is Black?”’ ‘Do gods help or hinder Black liberation?’ Through our work, students will also theorize the dynamic exchange between gods, societies, and subjectivities.", ,The Critical Review for RELS 0085D

Yet Christmas has not always loomed so large. Through encounters with such phenomena as sacred stories, consumer practices, and legal controversies, this course invites students to ask how and why Christmas became an important event.

It is an opportunity to become familiar not only with the Confucian canon and its main commentarial traditions, which undergirded education in East Asia into the nineteenth century, but also with the ways in which these ideas were rejected, adjusted, and reconfigured in early Daoist discussions, Neo-Confucian debates with Buddhists, and modern disputes over their socioeconomic, political, and/or gender impact. Readings are drawn from primary Chinese, Korean, and Japanese texts in translation, and from modern interpretations of Confucianism and its legacy.

Social and critical theorists from Marx to Foucault have argued that we only understand what religion really does if we interpret it with suspicion—if we refuse to take its claims at face value. Others have sought to redirect suspicion back against suspicion itself, and religious thinkers have sought to incorporate critiques of religion into their own theological projects. This seminar studies key figures in this complex interplay of religion and suspicion.

968,Slavic Studies,Demons and Angels in Russian Literature,Michal Oklot,"The literary images of fallen angels, as well as various poetic demonologies in Russian literature extend from the medieval apocrypha, up to famous works of the twentieth-century literature, like, for example, Bulgakov's Master and Margarita or Dostoevsky's Demons. Although, the Russian literary angels are in many respects related to their Western counterparts, the apocalyptic character of Russian spiritual culture makes them in many respects unique. Examining these images, the course addresses the important questions concerning the human condition in general. Angels as one critic said, ""represent something that was ours and that we have the potential to become again""; their essence is otherness. Consequently, their literary representations explore the possibilities of human existence as well as its central paradigms like, love, rebirth, mortality, or 'fallenness.' The course will analyze the images of angels and fallen angels (devils) in the works of the nineteenth and the twentieth-century Russian prose, visual art, and film - from romanticism to 'postmodernism' - in the context of the world literature and culture. Authors to be studied: Byron, Lermontov, Balzac, Dostoevskii, Sologub, Bulgakov, Nabokov, Erofeev. We will also discuss films by Tarkovskii and Wenders, Russian icons, and paintings by Vrubel.
